# Hexapod Robot for Terrain Navigation â€“ Project Summary

## Overview

This repository provides a summary of a research-oriented hexapod robot designed for terrain navigation and advanced mobility applications. The robot features a robust polycarbonate frame fabricated using FDM 3D printing, with leg designs supporting both 12-servo and 18-servo configurations. Its design enables stable locomotion over uneven and inclined surfaces using biologically inspired gait patterns.

The complete implementation, including CAD models, reports, and analyses, is part of an academic research project. This summary is intended for collaborators, researchers, and recruiters interested in multi-legged robotic systems.

## Key Features

- Polycarbonate-based body design for strength and impact resistance
- 3D-printed components optimized for durability using FDM technology
- 3 degrees of freedom per leg (coxa, femur, tibia) in the 18-servo configuration
- Supports multiple gaits, including tripod and wave gaits, for adaptable movement
- Includes forward and inverse kinematics for precise control
- Integrated torque analysis to ensure component compatibility
- Potential for onboard sensing and visual navigation using structure-from-motion techniques
